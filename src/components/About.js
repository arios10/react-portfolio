                    I am a junior full stack web developer. I want to continue to evolve
                    in this field and find a career in it. I currently deliver for Amazon,
                    but I would much rather code as I have great interest in it. I have experience
                    in working in teams during coding bootcamp and would like to put my skills to 
                    use in the real world!
